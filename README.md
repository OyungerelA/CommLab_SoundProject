# Auditory Camping Experience

## Project Description
This project is an interactive audio experience that tells the story of a family’s camping trip. After a common beginning during which the family packs up and heads to their camp site, the user is presented with an option to pick which family member’s story they’d like to listen to -- the toddler or teenager. The toddler’s sound experience was intended to incorporate fascination and magical elements/sounds. (add sentence about toddler track)

On the other hand, the teenager’s sound experience is a regular experience for the most part, with small elements that portray a typical teen such as dialogues (“ugh, this is so boring”) and behavior (walking far away from the family). Further, the teen’s sound track also ends in a surprising, horror ending -- which adds a contrast to an otherwise regular experience. 

## Implementation Process
We first decided on the overall concept of the camping trip experience. In order to incorporate interactivity, we initially envisioned two different user options: one for a pleasant, day time trip and another for a scary, nighttime trip. After feedback and discussion in class, we settled on allowing the user to choose between characters in the story (parents/child1/child2). Taking into consideration time constraints, we reduced the number of character options to two. 

We decided on an overall plotline that would have elements common to both character experiences so that the overall narrative would be cohesive. We then decided on frame/by/frame incidents for each character, collecting sounds and uploading them to a shared Google Drive folder. All of the voices in the soundtrack as well as crackling fire sounds were recorded by ourselves to fit our needs. 

Parallel to this process, we began working on the website and uploading the sound tracks as we made them. The choices made by the user shapes the audio experience, so interactivity became a major aspect of our website. We went with a more semi-realistic design and used original illustrations for the backgrounds. 

## Reflection/Evaluation
With regard to the visual experience on the website, our expectations were fully met (if not exceeded). We are very satisfied with the website's aesthetic and interactive elements.

The soundtracks proved harder to create than we’d expected. It was difficult to find some of the more specific sounds, and make sure all of the clips blended into the vast, forest environment. This was especially hard with the sounds we recorded in our closed rooms -- which stood out very clearly in the tracks despite editing it.
